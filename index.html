    <h1>🌼Daisies 🌼</h1>
    <p class="main-text">The daisy purportedly gets its name from the Old English phrase “daes eage,” or “day's eye,”<br> because of the way the flower blossoms at the first sign of dawn. 
        <br>They have been around since at least 2,200 BC, when the ancient Egyptians grew them in their gardens and used them as herbal medicine.<br>
        They are frequently associated with purity, childbirth, new beginnings, and cheerfulness.<br> Daisy petals symbolize innocence and are commonly associated with childhood memories of collecting wildflower bouquets. <br>Flower girls scatter Daisy petals at weddings to represent the purity of love</p>
